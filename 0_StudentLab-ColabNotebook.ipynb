    "# üñºÔ∏è Meme Generator Lab: Student Lab\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Ref repository: https://github.com/IFML-UT/MLLAcademy-2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're going to do inside of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to simulate and guide your interactions with the meme generator pipeline.\n",
    "We're going to walk through each step behind generating a meme - why a meme? --> it's **multi-modal!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We're going to use **natural language processing (NLP)** to generate new text on a topic of your choosing\n",
    "- We'll then take this generated caption and find the best image match for the text - this \"text to image\" type of generative AI is referred to as multi-modal. \n",
    "- Lastly, you'll use python libraries within this lab to bring the text and the image together to create a unique meme. \n",
    "\n",
    "## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap for the entire lab:\n",
    "> The lab is broken down into 3 major sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Working with LLMs & Inference**: You'll use an open source large language model (LLM) to generate a meme based on general topics or themes. You'll select the best caption from 3 results. We'll be using Meta's `Llama` model family for this text generation, and can experiment with others as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-modal Generative AI:** With your caption from the first part of the lab, you will use OpenCLIP to query the top 3 matches from a library of popular meme images to select the best image, based on your text caption. You'll understand what multi-modal means, and how a pre-trained vision transformer model like `ViT-B-32` can return relevant images based on text inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine both the generated text and best image into your final AI-meme for your finished product.** You'll have the option of sharing your favorite meme with the class by uploading it to our shared drive for the week. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:\n",
    "- Inputs a freeform meme idea or phrase\n",
    "- Classifies it into a pre-approved topic\n",
    "- Uses LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct (via Hugging Face) to generate 3 clean meme captions\n",
    "- Filters for profanity or off-topic content\n",
    "\n",
    "### For use later (after this lab) on your own: \n",
    "If you would like to clone this repo to your own computer, and run it later you can use the following command to copy it to your machine: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Run this cell first to install dependencies and import necessary modules.\n",
    "- This `git clone` command will create a folder called MLLAcademy-2025 in your current directory. \n",
    "- Note: you'll need to supply your own API tokens for access to any paid models, or to Hugging Face for any open-source hosted model.\n",
    "\n",

    "To help keep this lab computationally light and flexible for our lab use, we are using Hugging Face inference token (generated by IFML) for your use during this week. \n",
    "- API stands for application programing interface, once configured it allows two different software applications communicate and send data to one another. \n",
    "- This secret token will expire after this week. \n",

    "This next cell overlays the selected caption \"meme text\" onto your chosen image. \n",
    "- You can customize the font size and position below w/in this cell using the various code snippets; only uncomment 1 at a time to move the text around. You can do this by adding or removing the `#`'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab:**\n",
    "- We've added a dynamic font sizing system that scales text based on the image size.\n",
    "- If **Impact.ttf** is missing, we fall back to the default font.\n",
    "- You can change the font file and size in the `create_meme()` function!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: How is the text centered on the image?\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the leftover space on each axis by subtracting the text size from the image size, then divide by 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `position = ((image.width - text_width) // 2, (image.height - text_height) // 2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "finds the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) center points. This is a common approach in pixel-based graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've adjusted the cell's code - run the cell, and then click `Generate` within the widget to display your meme. This will also save a copy of your meme to `my_final_meme.png`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips: \n",
    "- The variable `font_size` controls how big your text font is relative to the size of the image. Decreasing this value will decrease the size of your font; increasing this value will increase the size of your font. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Feel free to re-run this cell as many times as you need to in order to get the text exactly where you want it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You *cannot* change your caption here‚Äîthis ensures consistency with what you searched for earlier!\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a function called `draw.multiline_text` in the cell below - this is used _both_ for the white text _and_ a black outline that helps contrast the text on the image and ensures it looks consistent with an expected \"meme style\". It's in this function you can adjust the \"left\", \"right\", or \"center\" justification of the text - or even the color of your text if you wish. It's setup with white text by default."
