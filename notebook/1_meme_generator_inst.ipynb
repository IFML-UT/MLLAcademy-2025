    "# 🖼️ Meme Generator Lab: Student Lab\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Ref repository: https://github.com/IFML-UT/MLLAcademy-2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're going to do inside of this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is used to simulate student interactions with the meme generator pipeline.\n",
    "Use it to validate that the full captioning stack is working before you begin creating a meme of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ Roadmap for the entire lab:\n",
    "> The lab is broken down into 3 major sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Working with LLMs & Inference**: You'll use an open source large language model (LLM) to generate a meme based on general topics or themes. You'll select the best caption from 3 results. We'll be using Meta's `Llama` model family for this text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-modal Generative AI:** With your caption from the first part of the lab, you will use OpenCLIP to query the top 3 matches from a library of popular meme images to select the best image, based on your text caption. You'll understand what multi-modal means, and how a pre-trained vision transformer model like `ViT-B-32` can return relevant images based on text inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine both the generated text and best image into your final AI-meme for your finished product.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How It Works:\n",
    "- Inputs a freeform meme idea or phrase\n",
    "- Classifies it into a pre-approved topic\n",
    "- Uses LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct (via Hugging Face) to generate 3 clean meme captions\n",
    "- Filters for profanity or off-topic content\n",

If you would like to continue to run this lab later on your own, you can do so by creating a free HuggingFace account, creating a token within the free tier (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and then pasting your new token into the cell's `getpass` feature below. \n",
